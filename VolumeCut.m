% |*VolumeCut cuts a three dimensional image stack along an arbitrary
% surface. The surface is defined by the user that specifies reference
% point coordinates in a MATLAB matrix. The program then fits a surface 
% passing through all reference points and uses the fitted surface to split
% the image stack in two halves.*|
%
% Each row of the reference points' matrix is the [X,Y,Z] coordinates of 
% each point on the cutting surface. VolumeCut will fit the missing points. 
%
% The program performs the following main operations:
%
% # Ask user to load the TIF image stack file from disk 
% # Ask user to load matrix containing coordinates of reference cut points
% # A surface if fitted across all reference points
% # If there are two reference matrixes, the average surface is computed
% # The image volume is cut in hald along the plane
% # Image halves are saved with suffixes "-Part1.tif" and "-Part2.tif"
%
% <<VolumeCutSingleSurface.PNG>>
%
% If one matrix of reference points is provided, the program cuts the
% image stack along that surface. 
% Pixels from Surface#1 to half-way surface are saved in "-part1.tif"
% Pixels from half-way surface to Surface#2 are saved in "-part2.tif"
% 
% <<VolumeCutTwoSurfaces.PNG>>
%
% If two matrixes of reference points are provided, the user is asked to
% select the mode of cutting:'
%
% # *Inside to halfway between planes:* 
%  Pixels from Surface#1 to half-way surface are saved in "-part1.tif" 
%  Pixels from half-way surface to Surface#2 are saved in "-part2.tif"
% # *Beginning to halfway between planes:* 
%  Pixels from beginning of stack to half-way surface are saved in "-part1.tif" 
%  Pixels from half-way surface to end of stack are saved in "-part2.tif"
% # *Inside/outside planes:* 
%  Pixels inside surfaces are saved in "-part1.tif" 
%  Pixels outside surfaces are saved in "-part2.tif"
%
% *Input:*
%
% * Image file: a 3D TIF image stack of the volume to cut
% * Reference points: one or two matrixes containing reference points
%  
% *Output:*
%
% * "imageFileName-part1.tif" containing pixels above the final cut surface
% * "imageFileName-part2.tif" containing pixels below the final cut surface
%
% *Dependencies:*
%
% * gridfit.m (surface fitting from reference points)
% * saveastiff.m (TIFF image writer more robust than imwrite)
% * txtBar.m (display progress a text progress bar in the command window)
